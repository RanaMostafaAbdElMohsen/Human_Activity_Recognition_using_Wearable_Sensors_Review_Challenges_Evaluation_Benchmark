## Summary

The OPPORTUNITY Dataset for Human Activity Recognition from Wearable, Object, and Ambient Sensors is a dataset devised to benchmark human activity recognition algorithms 

### About DataSet

#### Background & Info
- The dataset comprises the readings of motion sensors recorded while users executed typical daily activities:
	- Body-worn sensors: 7 inertial measurement units, 12 3D acceleration sensors, 4 3D localization information
	- Object sensors: 12 objects with 3D acceleration and 2D rate of turn
	- Ambient sensors: 13 switches and 8 3D acceleration sensors
	- Recordings: 4 users, 6 runs per users. Of these, 5 are Activity of Daily Living runs characterized by a natural execution of 
	  daily activities. The 6th run is a "drill" run, where users execute a scripted sequence of activities
	- Annotations/classes: the activities of the user in the scenario are annotated on different levels: "modes of locomotion" 
	  classes; low-level actions relating 13 actions to 23 objects; 17 mid-level gesture classes; and 5 high-level activity classes
-  Modes of locomotion:
	- Walk
	- Sit
	- Stand
	- Lie
	- NULL
-  Modes of Gesture:
	- Open Dishwasher
	- Open Drawer1
	- Open Drawer2
	- Open Drawer3
	- Open Fridge
	- Open Door1
	- Open Door2
	- Move Cup
	- Close Fridge
	- Close Door1
	- Close Door2
	- Clean Table
	- NULL


#### file Structure
- Consisit of multiple files  ADL runs for locomotio, Drill runs for gesture
